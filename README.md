# LLM-Remote-Assistant

An LLM-powered mobile assistant designed to remotely control a personal computer using natural language commands. This project leverages a polyglot microservice architecture to achieve a flexible, scalable, and powerful remote assistance tool.

## Project Status

**Current Phase: Milestone 1 Complete**

The project has successfully completed its first major milestone: **Checkpoint 1 - The Nervous System**.

The foundational infrastructure is now fully operational. This includes a complete, end-to-end communication loop where a test client (PC Agent) can send a message, have it processed by the entire backend microservice stack (API Gateway -> Go WebSocket Gateway -> Python Orchestrator), and receive a valid response.

### Key Achievements in Checkpoint 1:
- **Full DevOps Foundation:** Git repository, Docker Compose orchestration, and service Dockerfiles are established.
- **Microservice Architecture:** The API Gateway (NGINX), Real-time Gateway (Go), and Orchestrator (Python) services are running and communicating within a dedicated Docker network.
- **End-to-End Communication:** A live, bidirectional data flow from a test client to the backend and back has been successfully demonstrated and verified.

## Next Steps: Checkpoint 2

The next phase of development will focus on integrating the core intelligence of the project:

- **LLM Integration:** Connecting the Python Orchestrator to a Large Language Model (e.g., GPT, Gemini).
- **Dynamic Code Generation:** Implementing the logic for the LLM to translate natural language commands into executable Python code.
- **Remote Execution:** Sending the generated code back to the PC Agent for execution.
