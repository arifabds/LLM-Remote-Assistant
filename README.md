## Project Status

**Current Phase: Milestone 1 Complete**

The project has successfully completed its first major milestone: **Checkpoint 1 - The Nervous System**.

The foundational infrastructure is now fully operational. This includes a complete, end-to-end communication loop where a test client (PC Agent) can send a message, have it processed by the entire backend microservice stack (API Gateway -> Go WebSocket Gateway -> Python Orchestrator), and receive a valid response.

### Key Achievements in Checkpoint 1:
- **Full DevOps Foundation:** Git repository, Docker Compose orchestration, and service Dockerfiles are established.
- **Microservice Architecture:** The API Gateway (NGINX), Real-time Gateway (Go), and Orchestrator (Python) services are running and communicating within a dedicated Docker network.
- **End-to-End Communication:** A live, bidirectional data flow from a test client to the backend and back has been successfully demonstrated and verified.
